# Status

Note: The original December 2010 jar file has been preserved as Euchre_original_compile.jar for sake of testing the last-known public release.

There were no build instructions for the jar file to play the game that I could locate. So I created a build.xml for ANT that ca be used to compile, jar, and run the application.

When playing 1 human card player against 3 AI players, the game seems to stall and get stuck on whose turn it is.  This seems to happen in the original compiled jar of the game.  I have been unable to determine with ccertainy if this wa a bug in the software that was incompmplete - or perhaps neew java runtimes are not executing the older year 2010 code with the same behavior.

Please open an issue if you want to help contribute and compare notes.  Thank you.
